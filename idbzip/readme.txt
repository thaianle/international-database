International Database (IDB)
November 2024 Release

These data files correspond to the data available in the U.S. Census Bureau's API.

Each file is pipe "|" delimited, and the header row is demarcated with "#" at the start of the row.

The number of records in these files may exceed size limitations of standard spreadsheet software. Therefore, to load and query these data, you may need specialized software capable of working with larger datasets.

For additional technical specifications, including variable definitions, please visit https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/international-database.html
