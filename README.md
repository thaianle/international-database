# International Database
## Description of the project (Updated May 12, 2025)

An ongoing data analysis project, using the [International Database from the United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/international-programs/about/idb.html).

I used the common Python packages for data manipulation and visualization, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, and stored my detailed code and analysis results as Jupyter Notebooks.

Please read the [idbsingleyear-python.ipynb](https://github.com/thaianle/international-database/blob/main/idbsingleyear-python.ipynb) file first, then the [idb5yr-python.ipynb](https://github.com/thaianle/international-database/blob/main/idb5yr-python.ipynb) file. The analysis on the IDB 5-Year file is the continuation of the IDB Single Year file, so you can see many steps in common that I used to explore and analyze the data.
